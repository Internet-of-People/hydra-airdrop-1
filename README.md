First Hydra Airdrop
===================

Dear IOP Community,

Registration for the first Hydra airdrop has opened on Sunday, December 17, 2:00 PM UTC. To give everyone in the community a fair chance to get some Hydra, we are not distributing a fixed amount of Hydra per IOP.

Instead, we’re running a lottery.

To take part, you need a valid Ethereum address **that you have the private key for** to receive your Hydra tokens. You can register for the lottery using the IoPCommunityBot in our official [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/IoPofficial). It is best to talk to the bot using private messages, so people can use the channel for asking questions. The command used for registering an IOP address is `/%register YOUR_IOP_ADDRESS YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS SIGNATURE`. In this, `YOUR_IOP_ADDRESS` is the IOP address you want to register and `YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS` is the address you want to receive the Hydra on. `SIGNATURE` is generated by using the *Sign Message* function of your IoP Core wallet. Enter your Ethereum address in the message field, without any other symbols or whitespace. Choose the IOP address you want to register and click *Sign*. Copy the resulting signature into the command for the telegram bot. This is used to verify that you indeed own the IOP address you want to register.

Three helpful videos have been uploaded to our official Internet of People YouTube Channel, explaining how to [register for the first Hydra Airdrop](https://youtu.be/hvMySKfQZ7Q), how to [create an Ethereum wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1GyuVrW0yU), and how to [sign a message using the IoP Core wallet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-b5injckQk&feature=youtu.be).

When you register one of your IOP addresses for the lottery, you will be credited 1 ticket for every 2 full IOP in your account when we took the snapshot on Sunday, December 10, 7:00 PM UTC at Block 71417, up to a maximum of 250 tickets per IOP address. 

If you find an address is credited with fewer tickets than expected, please remember that your wallet generates change addresses everytime you send a transaction. Depending on their balance, these addresses might also be eligible. You can get a list of all addresses in your wallet--including change addresses--by running `listaddressgroupings` in the console found in your IOP Core Wallet under *Help->Debug Window->Console*. To find out which of these is eligible for registration, you can compare them against the snapshot data [here](src/data/snapshot.json). 

Registration will be open until Friday, December 22, 2:00 PM UTC. After registration closes, we will update this repository with the full registration data. 

The code for the lottery is already online and can be used by everyone to validate the result. Please be aware that the results of the lottery will only be fixed once registration is complete.

# FAQ

If you still have questions, you should be able to find the answers here.

**Q**: What is an airdrop?
**A**: An airdrop is a distribution of free cryptocurrency to holders of a different currency. It’s a way to establish a broad base of token holders, reward a certain group of people or just generate buzz for a new token.

**Q**: Does it cost anything?
**A**: No, an airdrop is a free gift.

**Q**: Why is this airdrop happening? Who is it for?
**A**: To celebrate the long-standing partnership between IoP and Libertaria, Libertaria is rewarding members of the IoP community with a free gift of Hydra, Libertaria’s new cryptotoken.

**Q**: What is Hydra?
**A**: Hydra is Libertaria’s new cryptotoken. Eventually it will run on Libertaria’s new Hydra blockchain protocol, but for now it is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain.

**Q**: How many Hydra tokens are being airdropped?
**A**: 500,000 Hydra tokens are being distributed in this airdrop.

**Q**: Is everyone eligible to receive free Hydra tokens?
**A**: No, only IOP addresses containing more than 2 IOP as of block 71417 (Sunday, December 10, 7:00 PM UTC) are eligible for this airdrop. However, more airdrops are planned for the near future, so keep hodling!

**Q**: Will every eligible address receive free Hydra tokens?
**A**: No, tokens will be distributed via a random lottery.

**Q**: So everyone has the same chance of receiving tokens?
**A**: Not exactly. The airdrop is being run as a lottery. You can receive tickets based on the number of IOP tokens you own. IOP holders are eligible for one lottery entry for every 2 IOP they hold, up to a maximum of 250 tickets (per wallet).

**Q**: Can I do anything to increase my chances?
**A**: Not any more. The distribution of tickets will be based on a snapshot of the IoP blockchain taken at block 71417 and is now fixed.

**Q**: Can I receive Hydra from my IOP on Bittrex?
**A**: No, you cannot receive Hydra tokens based on Bittrex holdings. Only IOP addresses for which you own the private keys are eligible to register for the lottery.

**Q**: What do I need to register my address?
**A**: You’ll need an eligible IOP address, an Ethereum wallet address for a wallet supporting ERC20 tokens and an IOP wallet capable of signing a message using the private key for the eligible IOP address. The official IoP Core wallet is perfect for this, exchange addresses are NOT :)

**Q**: Which wallets support ERC20 tokens?
**A**: There are several options, but we recommend MyEtherWallet.com. We have created a short instruction video explaining how to set up a wallet address in MEW.

**Q**: How do I register my address?
**A**: You can register your address in our official IoP Token telegram channel by messaging our bot.

**Q**: The bot says I need a signature. What’s that?
**A**: We need a cryptographic signature to verify that you own the ETH address you’re trying to register. In your IoP core wallet, select “Sign Message” from the File menu. Paste the eligible IoP address in the top bar and your ETH address in the message box. Click the Sign Message button and the signature will be generated. You can use the Copy button to the right of the signature to copy it to the clipboard.

**Q**: I’m pretty sure I had an eligible amount of tokens in an eligible IOP address at the time of 71417. However, when I try to register the address with the bot I get a message saying “That IoP address isn't on the list of IoP addresses eligible for this airdrop. Sorry.” Why am i getting that message?
**A**: First check this list for the address. If it’s not in the list don’t worry it may have been stored in a different address than you think. Go to Help>Debug window>Console tab and enter listaddressgroupings and hit return. In the console window you will see all the addresses that the wallet used for your transactions. Check that list against the first list and you should find the tokens you’re looking for.
